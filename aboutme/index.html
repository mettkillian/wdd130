    <p>Hello Everyone! I am in my final semester at BYU-I. I am a CIT major with a minor in CIS. I have owned an IT
        Managed Services company since 2003,
        and have come back to school to finish my degree. My wife and I have been married for 31 years. We have four
        children, two still at home. Things I
        love to do are golf, record music, and restore older cars. My current project is a C5 Corvette Convertible. It
        is almost finished, but parts
        have been hard to come by in the pandemic.
    </p>

        One advantage web development has provided me is allowing me to produce or edit web content for my clientelle
        without having to hire it out to
        web developers. It has made my company more profitable by completing these projects in-house. I did this a
        little backwards, however. Three
        years ago I took CIT230 before I took this class. I wish I would have known this course existed first. The thing
        I love most about BYU-I
        is the learning model. Teaching each other and sharing our knowledge with others is a great method of learning.
