                <h2>Care Tips</h2>
                <p>There are many do’s and don’ts in caring for your multi-layer 
                    clear-coat painted sheet molded compound (SMC) body panels. Paint 
                    corrections are costly and complete paint restoration is the most 
                    expensive part of putting new life back into your car. It is critical 
                    that care be taken to not etch the chrome finishes or cloud the 
                    clearcoat with spiral paint damage. We completely endorse Meguire’s 
                    car care products from their leather reconditioner to their Ultimate 
                    polymer wax for that sleek, wet, freshly painted look. Using Meguire’s 
                    claybar process to remove impurities from the paint, and Quick Detailer 
                    for in-between warm water handwashes, Meguire’s has every product to keep 
                    your car protected and looking new. Shown below is a 1999 C5 Convertible 
                    in Torch Red with a coat of Meguire’s Ultimate topped with a coat of 
                    Megure’s Platinum carnuba wax for that deep, warm shine. Done right, 
                    your car’s wax should last an entire season when handwashed with Megurie’s 
                    Deep Crystal car wash soap. Don’t forget to apply Meguire’s tire dressing 
                    and wheel cleaner! To help keep your car dust and lint-free between washings, 
                    the Original California car duster will pull wax-dulling fine-particle dust 
                    off your prized finish with just one sweeping motion.

                <h2>Photos and Shows</h2>
                <p>Have you ever wondered how to get that picture perfect photo of your C5? Shown 
                    above is an example taken with a 4K camera in the lazy afternoon sun during 
                    the dog days of August. By having photos professionally taken of your vehicle, 
                    you can submit for entry in any of the hundreds of classic car shows across 
                    the nation, or post your photos in Corvette forums, put your car up for sale 
                    in Autotrader, or even enter your car in auctions to draw out the highest bidders. 
                    Selecting the proper site, perfect lighting, and getting attention grabbing 
                    viewpoints are paramount to fully displaying the C5’s sleek curves designed by 
                    Chevrolet’s John Cafaro. Knowing how to properly detail and transport your vehicle 
                    are critical to getting the judges attention in your AAA sponsored car shows. We’ll 
                    show you how to attain your highest scores and crush the competition. The C5 is a 
                    show-stopper all on its own, but with show-legal tips, we can help you achieve the 
                    attention-getting satisfaction of knowing your car will place every time! Entering 
                    shows and featuring your car in restoration magazines is just the beginning! Building 
                    your investment and frame-over restoration is a rewarding process, and 
                    what better car than the Corvette?

                <h2>The LS1 Engine</h2>
                <p>In 1997, the LS1 engine was the brainchild of Chevrolet engineers. It
                    replaced the powerful but inefficent LT4 engine that failed to meet
                    the new emissions restrictions put in place by the Federal government. 
                    Refusing to abandon the small-block push rod design that put Chevrolet
                    at the top of the performance V8 chain for more than 30 years, Chevrolet
                    Engineers determined to stick with the small-block design but give it an
                    all new all aluminum block and heads, new intake, ingnition, and ECM
                    tune to produce an unheard of 345 horsepower and 350 ft pounds of torque
                    while still meeting California and Federal Emission standards. It was
                    the beginning of the LS era, the most widely swapped and beloved
                    small-block engine of all time.
