      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>W05 Elevator Pitch
        Is that your C2 427 Stingray in the parking lot? I’m an IT Adminstrator, and also a car enthusiast. I’d like the opportunity to get together and discuss a possible web site project where fellow Corvette owners, like yourself, could post photos, how-to-tips, and have discussions about their cars. I think there is great community of car owners that we could tap and maybe create some advertising revenue. I’ve got some ideas and can put together a few wireframes to review with you. Can I give you a call in a couple of weeks to discuss these ideas and gather your input?
    
    Review 1 (My wife): Great; just more opportunities to talk about  your car. You are going to do it whether I think it’s a great idea or not. Slow down, it’s supposed to be 60 seconds.
    
    Review 2 (My 18-year-old son): Sure. Don’t they already have Vette forums? I can’t tell if you are trying to sell a website or apply for a job?
    
    Review 3 (My car collecting buddy): Excellent idea. I have some car photos I want to put on it already! Let me know when you build it!

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is anyone who is interested in the fifth generation Corvette comprising model years from 1997 thru 2004. This could be C5 owners, car enthusiats, perspective C5 buyers,
        or maybe even classic car dealers or the media. Primarily, this will limit the age of the audience to middle-aged men, as a car like this can not be financed for its age, and usually is 
        purchased with cash. Some women fall in this category, but the primary target audience will be men from ages 35 and up.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Welcome to the C5Vette page, where we talk all things about the fifth generation Corvette; America’s only domestic production sports car. Here you will find facts, specifications, and care tips for your Corvette. Not a Corvette owner? No problem! Here you will find information that may help guide you into your first C5 investment. Our page will contain many links to Corvette forums and dealers to provide you with contact information that may help put you in touch with the right people to make sure you have all the tools to locate and purchase a C5, the most beautiful and widely recognized generation of Corvette. 

From the C5 coupe, to the C5 convertible, or the all new in 1999 fixed-roof coupe (FRC), we will cover all of the models produced between 1997 and 2005, including the coveted 2003 50th Anniversary series. Packed with 345 horsepower from the all-new for 1997 LS1 aluminum engine, this generation of Corvette was way ahead of its time, launching Chevrolet into the Supercar arena outperforming the Porsche 911 and even the Ferrari F355. The C5 FRC Z06 comes race-ready right out of the box for autocross and drag race enthusiasts. The C5 convertible is a world-class spyder for country touring, and the coupe with its removable targa top is the ultimate high-performance daily driver.

      <h3>Photos and Shows</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered how to get that picture perfect photo of your C5? Shown below are two examples taken with a 4K camera in the lazy afternoon sun during the dog days of August. By having photos professionally taken of your vehicle, you can submit for entry in any of the hundreds of classic car shows across the nation, or post your photos in Corvette forums, put your car up for sale in Autotrader, or even enter your car in auctions to draw out the highest bidders. Selecting the proper site, perfect lighting, and getting attention grabbing viewpoints are paramount to fully displaying the C5’s sleek curves designed by Chevrolet’s John Cafaro. 

Knowing how to properly detail and transport your vehicle are critical to getting the judges attention in your AAA sponsored car shows. We’ll show you how to attain your highest scores and crush the competition. The C5 is a show-stopper all on its own, but with show-legal tips, we can help you achieve the attention-getting satisfaction of knowing your car will place every time! Entering shows and featuring your car in restoration magazines is just the beginning! Building your investment and frame-over restoration is a rewarding process, and what better car than the Corvette?

      <h3>Care Tips</h3>
      <p>
        There are many do’s and don’ts in caring for your multi-layer clear-coat painted sheet molded compound (SMC) body panels. Paint corrections are costly and complete paint restoration is the most expensive part of putting new life back into your car. It is critical that care be taken to not etch the chrome finishes or cloud the clearcoat with spiral paint damage. 

We completely endorse Meguire’s car care products from their leather reconditioner to their Ultimate polymer wax for that sleek, wet, freshly painted look. Using Meguire’s claybar process to remove impurities from the paint, and Quick Detailer for in-between warm water handwashes, Meguire’s has every product to keep your car protected and looking new. Shown below is a 1999 C5 Convertible in Torch Red with a coat of Meguire’s Ultimate topped with a coat of Megure’s Platinum carnuba wax for that deep, warm shine. Done right, your car’s wax should last an entire season when handwashed with Megurie’s Deep Crystal car wash soap. Don’t forget to apply Meguire’s tire dressing and wheel cleaner! To help keep your car dust and lint-free between washings, the Original California car duster will pull wax-dulling fine-particle dust off your prized finish with just one sweeping motion.
